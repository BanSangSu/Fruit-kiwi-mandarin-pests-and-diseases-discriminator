# Fruit (Kiwi, Mandarin) Pests and Diseases Discriminator

## Abstract
Our model can determine whether kiwi and mandarin are infested with pests and identify healthy fruits.

## Feature
1. **SE block** improves performance through normalisation in the classification layer  
2. With **EfficientNet**, we can get better performance at a lower cost than ResNet.  
3. Improved performance by performing data augmentation with preprocessing.  

## Summary
1. By decreasing the learning rate in the fine-tuning process, you can train more to achieve higher performance.  
2. Although we used supervised learning for this project, we believe that classification models using unsupervised and self-supervised learning would improve performance.
